# [DRAFT] Version Control Workflows

#HSLIDE

## Current Reposiroty Structure

- **Trunk**
    + Dev workline - where almost every work is done

- **Stable**
    + QA testing branch - revisions that are made and tested on **Trunk** should be merged in this branch
    + Bug fixes related to the code located here should be fixed first on **Trunk** and then merged here.

- **Release**
    + Created by QA after a version on **Stable** is ready for release
    + Only hotfixes are allowed here

- **Private**
    + Temporary branch that should be used for work that can break the **Trunk** - e.g.: New Features, experimental work.

#HSLIDE

## Some attention points

- Cherry picking merges became the norm.
- **Trunk** and **Stable** have independent life cicles but are maintained by the same users.
- Inconsistence between both branches history and code.
- Fixing **Stable** bugs on **Trunk** can lead to a inconsistent fix.
- A code that works on **Trunk** may not work on **Stable** as is.
