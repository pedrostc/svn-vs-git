* [Fowler - Version Control Tools](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/VersionControlTools.html)
    - "Ben Butler-Cole phrased it (about git) beautifully: "there is this amazingly powerful thing writhing around in there that will basically do everything I could possibly ask of it if only I knew how"".
    - "Whatever the reason git seems to be attractive more to those who enjoy learning the internals while mercurial seems to appeal more to those who just want to do version control" -> Consider HG  also?

* [Fowler - Feature Branch](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureBranch.html)
    - Points to how separate branches can (will) cause huge merges and some headache with them.
    - Also points that, as a consequence os the merge problems, the fear os refactoring can emerge (in our case it seems that it already exists)
